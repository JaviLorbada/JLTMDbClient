==============


- JLTMDbClient is an iOS wrapper on top of AFNetworking to interact with [themoviedb.org](www.themoviedb.org) API.

## Installation: ##

- The best way to get JLTMDbClient is by using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). 
- [How to install CocoaPods](https://speakerdeck.com/javilorbada/introduction-to-cocoapods?slide=13)

## Demo App:

1. Clone the repository:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:JaviLorbada/JLTMDbClient.git
```
2. Installing Pods:
```
$ pod install --verbose
```
** If you don't use / like Cocoapods, just [download the zip](https://app.box.com/s/4bxyuvrgzusv6u7d5z9a).

3. Open the ```.xcworkspace``` file to see the example:
```
$ open JLTMDbClient.xcworkspace
```
4. Run JLTMDbClient target to see a simple visual example.

5. Run JLTMDbClientTests target to see different cases on how to use the API.

## Usage: ##

1. Get your API KEY from [themoviedb.org](http://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)

> "A TMDb user account is required to request an API key. Commercial users are approved on a per application basis. As always, you must attribute TMDb as the source of your data. Please be sure to read the [API FAQ](http://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api)"

2. Add JLTMDbClient to your application, and set up your API KEY.

```
#import <JLTMDbClient.h>
```

```
[[JLTMDbClient sharedAPIInstance] setAPIKey:@"API_KEY"];
```
3. Call a service to get the response from the server *, i.e:


```
[[JLTMDbClient sharedAPIInstance] GET:kJLTMDbMoviePopular withParameters:nil andResponseBlock:^(id response, NSError *error) {
    if(!error){
        fetchedData = response;
        NSLog(@"Popular Movies: %@",fetchedData);
    }
}];
```

## Unit Tests: ##

- JLTMDbClient includes unit tests. In order to run the unit tests, you must install the testing dependencies via CocoaPods:

```
$ pod install --verbose
```

- Once testing dependencies are installed, you can execute the tests using JLTMDbClientTests scheme within Xcode.

### Using xctool

- Tests can also be run from the command line or within a continuous integration environment with [`xctool`](https://github.com/facebook/xctool), which can be installed with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh):

```
$ brew update
$ brew install xctool --HEAD
```

> "JLTMDBClientTests requires xctool [0.1.14](https://github.com/facebook/xctool/releases/tag/v0.1.14) or above"

- Once `xctool` is installed, you can execute the tests via `rake test`.
